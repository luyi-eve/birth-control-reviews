It’s an exhausting and consistently frustrating take on a crucial service. I absolutely love the concept of getting it delivered and being able to do it all online. First month was fine. Every month since they have tried charging my card anywhere from $8-$10 even though under my insurance all forms of birth control pills are free at no cost to me at all. Every time I’ve tried to explain that to the staff at Nurx their only response is to talk to my insurance… even if I’ve already told them that I have. I can explain it to them all day I only get automated responses, never any real help at all. Also the customer service is the worst I’ve seen on any online platform. It takes up to 6 days for someone to get back to you on anything. The earliest for me was 3 days. So you send them a message and by the time they respond you’re so close to running out of pills that you rush to get it taken care of. 
Also you can specify on your app settings that you want to be notified if insurance doesn’t cover it before you’re charged. At first I had it turned off then after the second month I turned it on. Well then they just charged me without any heads up the third month, completely ignoring my preference. Then, when I looked at the settings it was gone. 
If I hadn’t spent the money on the annual fee I would drop it. However any more of this insanity and I’ll just delete it all together. So sick of it.",1,False,Emilie Bo-Bemely.,What a Nightmare,nurx-birth-control-delivered,1213141301,"- l2_delayed_customer_service

3,2023-11-30 22:46:13,,I was happy with my first order of 1 pack of birth control which was covered by my insurance and I had no issues. My second order is where things got really shady. They told me that my insurance wouldn’t cover my prescription so I would have to pay out of pocket. I called my insurance and asked why they weren’t covering it. They said that my prescription was covered and that they would cover a refill for the 1 pack but the problem was that Nurx requested a refill for a 2 pack which is not my prescription or what I was receiving from them. My prescription was for 1 pack and I was only getting 1 pack delivered so there was no reason they should have requested a 2 pack. I asked Nurx for a refund since my insurance did cover my medication but Nurx made a mistake when ordering it. The second story they made up why they charged me was because I had an “invalid ID or DOB”. That was just a lie because if that were true they wouldn’t have been able to bill my insurance for my first order. I asked them how they were able to get my first order if my ID was invalid and then they made up another story. This time they couldn’t bill the insurance because it “wasn’t selected as my preferred form of payment”. If that were true then why did they “try” to bill my insurance in the first place? I had to file a dispute with my bank and thankfully got my money back. Don’t fall for this scam like I did.

However, the NURX marketing team is doing the medical providers a massive disservice and ultimately costing the NURX company thousands of dollars. 

Once you’re a client, NURX will start sending you targeted ad emails offering you their other services… you’d think they would bother to tailor their ads to the recipient, but they do not. Instead, they will advertise every single service they offer regardless of if the medical information you’ve given them in the past poses any contraindications to the new service they are trying to sell you.

What that does, is get people to try out the new service and pay for the consultation fee of the new service. Then, a doctor has to waste their time reviewing a new patient request on a contraindication NURX already knew about and had on file. 

All this tells me, is NURX doesn’t care about their clients or care providers time. They want more money from you so badly, they will waste an hour of a doctors time (which costs more to NURX than whatever you would pay for a consultation fee) ultimately, spending more company money than if they had been bothered to do literally ANY research before marketing (seemingly) blind.",2,False,floofscoops,Works but inefficient,nurx-birth-control-delivered,1213141301,"The review text can be classified under the following category:

I had three prescriptions going: birth control and two acne medications. After repeated problems with taking all three, I put a hold on all prescriptions. I found out Nurx had pulled $50 on a prescription that had not only been placed on hold but was also previously covered by insurance. I had let the care team know that I had no interest in prescriptions that weren’t covered by my insurance and to notify me if anything changed. I called to try and get it refunded, and the lady who helped me was extremely short and borderline rude. I was told there was nothing she could do since it had been shipped. I was told the best she could do was put all of my prescriptions on demand or hold, which they already were. When I asked clarifying questions on how it was even charged in the first place, I was cut off and ultimately hung up on with a “Have a blessed day.""

Once you submit your request, it will be at least 3 - 5 days before your prescription gets filled to send out. Also if you do have insurance and try to use it with Nurx they normally decline to cover it due to most insurances having their own online pharmacy option. Therefor you will have to wait 1 - 2 weeks for the authorizations team at Nurx to confirm insurance denial before providing you a coupon. 
These factors are not a huge issue if you already have birth control and are switching to an online method as opposed to seeing a doctor or gynecologist, but if you need birth control urgently, this is not the app for you. I wouldn’t even chance trying to get the emergency contraception from them unless you are getting it for a future scenario. 
Now, on to the customer service of the support team - very inconsistent. Sometimes they are very kind, quick and efficient but more often than not they are very rude, unwelcoming and fairly unhelpful.

First they prescribed Amethia which is supposed to give you a period once every three months. I bled continuously for all three months, had terrible headaches and spiraled into my worst depression. When I contacted them about these side effects, they said it was normal and sent me another three months worth. Trusting them, I went another two months (still bleeding the whole time) before I told them to switch me to monthly pills. They tried to push back still saying it was normal and then said they would ‘forward my concerns.’ I got a notification that my Rx was being shipped and had to send multiple frantic messages confirming that they weren’t sending Amethia again. A few months after that, at the year mark, renewing my prescription with them was a pain. First they tried to charge me $60 ($15 for a renewal consultation and $45 for three months of pills).

Then they needed a reason why I was cancelling as if they were going to do anything about it. Then another worker tried to say that they couldn’t do anything about it and that it was shipped even though on the app it clearly says the prescription is still being processed and USPS only says that a shipping label was made.

They charge $40 “consultation fee” just to review your request which is not covered by insurance at all, even though they explicitly said I wouldn’t be charged ANYTHING until I was able to review my copay options. And I never had a consultation at all. Just submitted my information and got an automated response. Then much later a doctor reached out with some generic message that wasn’t specific to me at all and didn’t address any of my personal concerns. But that $40 is nonrefundable and unrelated to my insurance- which they later informed me they don’t work with anyway. I signed up seeking acne treatment, two separate medications which are only available in three month supplies apparently. So $30 per treatment per month, would’ve totaled over $180 before I had ever received or tried anything. After trying to cancel one of the two medications for days because I can’t afford that, I finally had it paused so I wouldn’t be charged over $200 (including the $40 processing/ review fee) for acne treatment that may or may not work for me.

I finally got used to it but after a month and a half two weeks ago I woke up from a terrible pain in my back as the day went on it got worse and spread to my side and stomach I had to leave work and go to the hospital immediately. They saw pneumonia from a ct scan and sent me home with meds and told me to come back a week later to check progress. A few days later it was even worse my breathing had gotten bad and I was bed ridden the whole week that’s how bad it hurt and I couldn’t move , I couldn’t go to the bathroom by myself or lift my arm to eat my family had to help take care of me and luckily I had a bunch of pto now more than ever I needed to be working, so when I went back they did every test including covid 19 (2nd test two weeks apart) after a couple of days and test they discovered that the birth control is what had caused a blood clot to form in my lungs. Out of all the warnings they gave me when I signed up this wasn’t one so I messaged them about what happened after I unsubscribed but they never responded. I didn’t want my money back but I want them to know I’m very healthy it’s not something in my family history and I went to a professional to see what happened I didn’t diagnose myself. I doubt other people are being warned about this and with this being my first experience to try it out I had no way of knowing but the doctors told me any oral birth control can give you blood clots so I would be very careful and maybe talk with a doctor about the different birth control options and asking the side effects for those because I feel they will tell you everything you need to know. For now I’m stuck taking 500 dollar a month blood thinners for  who knows how long.

My 3 month experience with Nurx was incredibly terrible and I would never be back and use their services for birth control subscriptions! 

I used to pick up my pack monthly at local Walgreens. One day I was advertised on Instagram about Nurx and I thought oh I d like to try this and it could save me the trips to local pharmacy! The first month pack went well in terms of billing and delivery. Then my nightmare started from the second month...they have messaged me with regard to my insurance billing problem and asked me to contact my insurance company or update my insurance card on file. I called my insurance company and they confirmed that everything I had provided to Nurx was correct and up to date. That was what I originally thought because Nurx had billed my insurance company for the same thing literally a month ago. Then I called Nurx (tried to message them but never got a response) to confirm my insurance information and they explained that they switched to some sort of new partner pharmacy and my prescription was not sent to them. The problem was not really with billing but miscommunication with their partner pharmacy on their end. That back and forth conversation wasted almost two weeks and I didn’t have time to wait for them to process and mail me the new pack so they sent the prescription to local pharmacy for me to pick up and they said that the next month pack should be back on track.

And when it came to the third pack, I contacted Nurx to mail my pack a week earlier than the targeted date so that I would be able to get it before I run out of my current pack. They confirmed to process it on the date I mentioned but never did as promised...I have waited for another five days or so and they sent me another devastating message saying my insurance was not covering my prescription any more.

I’ve been using Nurx for over a year and was loving it until they started shipping my nuvaring without ice in the middle of July (90+ degrees). The safe temp for this drug is no more than 88 degrees and it’s not supposed to be stored above 77. Their response is always “then pick it up from your pharmacy for a fee” (I’d just get it from my gyno then) or “watch your tracking and bring it right in.” Which would require the tracking to be updated immediately (never is) and for me to be home when it arrives. Here’s the thing- I happen to know it needs to be kept cold. What about all of the women who are using this method of birth control and don’t know it is unreliable if left in the heat? They are unprotected and Nurx does not care and will not tell them. I had to go to my gynecologist and get samples of the nuvaring because nurx told me “don’t use it, buy another one out of pocket for $100” This app could be so great if they actually cared about the health and safety of their users.",1,True,DA1894,Convenient but dangerous shipping practices,nurx-birth-control-delivered,1213141301,"- l2_delayed_customer_service

Not for those who know their own body and what they want/need. The staff are kind and reply quickly but they choose for you, it's not as customizable as you think. I felt backed into a corner. At least it was by a nice doctor🤷‍♀️

The scoop: I've taken progesterone only birth control for 10+ years. I switched from the pill to the shot due to side effects that started after I developed hypothyroidism, but it didn't help. This  included yeast infections, ovarian cysts, breast size diminished/uneven, cystic acne, spotting and brown blood, irregular paps, low estrogen levels, the list goes on. My OB said birth control could be causing it, so I stopped taking it. ALL my symptoms went away but the acne. So I went to a dermatologist. Now I'm required to take birth control for the acne medicine prescribed to me. So I thought ""easy, let's try an app to avoid going somewhere in person, nurx looks good"". I tried to select the patch because I didn't want to experience the same side effects again. The questionnaire asked if I have migraines with aura (which is common for us hypo folks). From there, the doctor nixed my plan of taking the patch for safety reasons, and left me with only two options - progesterone only pill and shot, the very two options that ruined me physically in the past. So all in all, if you're just looking for birth control and don't care what you get, this app should be great.

I find it to be not very natural in the flow of how to find everything. You can message anyone which is nice, but in order to call I have to go to the desktop site and log in. The phone number is not in the app. Every attempt to log in sends me right back to the app. So I’m in a loop of not getting what info I need.  That’s not even my main concern though. 

Insurance/prescribing/delivery was all simple and upfront at first. However, I had some specific requests for my birth control and expected to be able to discuss it with a dr, but a prescription was just written without me being able to discuss those things. It’s been 8 years since I’ve been on a birth control so I couldn’t just chose my favorite and I didn’t have any info about what specific ones they thought could work. I decided to just go with it and see.

I got it and then the second month they sent me a generic, and a lot of women have problems between generic and name brand effecting them differently, and I was nervous. Changing up the script without asking me rubbed me wrong and I was annoyed. I am aware that you can choose at the beginning of signing up if a generic is ok, but I didn’t think that meant they’d switch mid order after already getting you going on name brand. Feels like a bait and switch thing. 

Shortly after, I decided to see a specialist locally regarding my needs, will no longer be using birth control and requested to cancel. Which you can’t cancel just on your own. You have to go through someone, which is also annoying. It’s my money being spent for something in my own body and I shouldn’t have to contact them to end the service. The guy replied with some copy and pasted answers that were not at all what I asked and then he told me I couldn’t send back my already dispensed meds and I couldn’t cancel any upcoming ones. I didn’t ask to return the used meds, and I certainly can cancel at any time. 

Their info says I can cancel and make changes to my upcoming order right now so I screen shot their own info and sent it back and asked him to actually address the concerns this time. Even if it was too late to alter this month’s order why would he say I can’t cancel? It made a mediocre experience into a bad one to deal with push back on canceling my own medication. 

6 weeks later I got a message that my script was shipped. I checked and it was still somehow active. The employee stated that it was too late to change the current order but I could change future ones. So the previous guy either hadn’t cancelled it or messed up somehow.

I was taking a specific birth control prescribed by Nurx and everything was going great. I got a text literally saying “We're preparing your prescription refill in the next few days. No action is required from you :).” Nowhere did they say they were switching my medication to generic, nor did the text state the name of the medication, and since it clearly stated ‘refill’ I assumed it was the same medication. 

The next text from Nurx was a confirmation text that my birth control had shipped but in this text it listed the name of the medication which was totally different. The was not notice anywhere else that I would be receiving a generic version until AFTER they had already shipped it. 

I called customer service panicking because anyone who takes medication knows generics can be totally different than name brands. I personally have had horrible reactions to generics before, and additionally I have a thyroid condition and maintaining hormone balance is already a real issue for me. To have my medication switched with no notice was extremely upsetting.

The customer service representative and supervisor both assured me the medical team would take care of it, but I just received a message from the doctor basically saying, “too bad too sad it’s already shipped and those conditions don’t qualify you for non generic.”

My new prescription didn’t come through and was canceled, and I did not get notified. In 2 months I ran out of pills and accidentally found that Nurx is not preparing a new 3-month supply order for me. I had to submit multiplw messages and it took me about 1 month to finally get my nee pack. 

For some reason I decided that this was a one-time issue and I decided to try their rosacea treatment. They charged me $35 for the questionnaire, then they said that azelaic acid would cost $75 and metrogel $35 out of pocket, so I requested to cancel azelaic acid because The Ordinary has azelaic acid for $15 and only requested to send me metrogel which I can’t find without prescription. I’ve spent a lot of time trying to get their customer support team to help me. They canceled my order without notifying me. I was charged $35 and didn’t receive anything. Why do they even advertise these skin solutions if they just charge you and give you nothing in exchange, it’s a scam.

Then I wanted to get a couple of packages of birth control pills out pf schedule and pay out of pocket to prevent running out of pills as now I am aware that such problems might happen. They created a new order, then canceled it. I wrote to support and requested to receive the order again, but they canceled it again in just 1 day.

I don’t understand why is that so hard to just provide service and why the orders keep canceling without explanations. My FSA card stopped working with them. Customer service is ineffective.

It’s astonishing this company can be so careless with the customers that rely on them for medication. 

11/3/23 Updated to add: Customer service continues to be abhorrent. I made a simple request via chat to pay for 1 prescription out of pocket, then resume my insurance covered prescriptions. I requested this multiple times and representatives agreed. However, after the out of pocket was completed, my credit card was charged instead of insurance the next month. I reached out and received half of my refund. When I requested the rest, they indicated the refund already been provided. They clearly don’t read back in the conversation to figure out what was charged and what was owed. Be prepared for them respond, “we apologize for the delayed reply.

First of all, they changed my routinely taking birth control pills to another brand which is at cheaper prices for no reason. Secondly, I uploaded my ID and insurance card to make sure they'd reach out to my insurance company for reimbursement. The first time they dispatched my pills they charged me for $45 and I was surprised because my insurance company has been covering the cost for birth control pills for the past two years. So I contacted their customer service and they agreed to cancel that charge after a long and painful discussion with their technician. They also promised me that from then on they'll start charging on the insurance company. Until recently I found out that they've been charging me every 3 months for $45 and when I called them, they kept saying that it is my responsibility to contact my insurance company for reimbursement. They don't even care when the customer doesn't want to continue to use their services. 

Overall I don't think it's worth it to pay 15$ membership fee to Nurx. You can definitely get into less trouble if you choose somewhere else, especially that you need to take the pills regularly.

I trusted it and figured I would have had a positive LH test on the one day that was skipped for testing. I had green days from then on.

Additionally because it completely would not allow me to submit the first period (only options were “breakthru bleed” or “spotting”, this was neither -one of the heaviest periods of my life) the “algorithm” has my anticipated cycles WAY longer than it actually is (35 days vs 26- actual).

I really liked Natural Cycles at first. I learned a lot about my body and it’s patterns. However, it seems like their algorithm didn’t learn as much as I did. After 3 regular cycles, the app went haywire and told me that my current cycle was going to be inexplicably 5 days shorter. I emailed customer service about it, as it seemed this was a technical error, but they doubled down. This made it very confusing to figure out what day I should expect my next period because the app starting counting those days in my next cycle. The app told me that my period was late, which is not something taken lightly on a TTC journey. On the day that my regular period typically starts, the app told me that I should take a pregnancy test and that they were “keeping their fingers crossed for me.” I emailed custom service about the issues and their response was to hide behind the algorithm unapologetically and to stress the “importance of measuring to our guidelines”—the assumption being that I wasn’t.

I was unable to properly connect to my ring and became very frustrated. After unsuccessfully trying to get in touch with a REAL member of customer service (NOT the chat bot), I was then charged for a full subscription. I was again unable to reach customer service to explain that I would like a refund so that I can restart the trail membership and decide if I want to continue. I am sure many people can relate to the sentiment that they do not have time for an app that is not quick, easy, and offering substantial improvement or value to life. I honestly cannot believe I am taking the time to write this review now, but I am very disturbed by the fact that I could not get past the chat bot to speak to a real member of customer service. Furthermore, I have NEVER had an experience with an app that offers no refunds or even the chance to speak to a representative. 
Regarding all the positive reviews (if they are real)— maybe this is a good app. I just caution everyone that there is no wiggle room or help offered with the subscription. Make sure you can use and have the time to decide for yourself if you would like to continue with the subscription within their defined time period.

I’m shocked this is FDA approved. This happen after 2 months of using the app with the Oura ring. I had almost perfect temp tracking because I didn’t have to manually upload my temps. I was using the Inito concurrently and it told me I had high fertility the same day. I was confused by that, and we went with natural cycles data which I see now is very limited in its ability to accurately project ovulation. 3 days later, my detailed hormone data in Inito shows I ovulated. (I was only even using Initial because I wanted to see what my hormone levels were like at 36 years old for when we started trying eventually.) So, essentially this app told me I was safe to have sex 3 days before I ovulated which was actually the perfect timing to get pregnant! Maybe if you have a super regular cycle down to the day this app would work. I would understand if I slipped up and had sex on a day it said I was fertile that would be my own user error.

There should be a little heart emoji or something to show which days you had sex on the calendar instead of just the daily info. I think anything more than $30/year for this app is too much especially for the flimsy thermometer that was included. You have to turn the light on to see the temperature and the app says the thermometer will save the temp if you wanna snooze but when you turn it back on it only flashes for a second and if you don’t catch it you have to retake your temp anyway. In 2023, I don’t know why you pressure your clients to get this thermometer that doesn’t even have Bluetooth. This is very old technology and I’m very disappointed that I spent my limited income on this thinking it would help me conceive. $100 down the drain. I feel like I got played. This app tracks all the same information that countless free apps do. 

There is no reason to pay this money for something I already get for free. Apps like Clue, Ovia, Premom and Apple Health all offer the exact same insights for free with no ads, no gimmicks and no promise of insurance reimbursement. Since they don’t offer refunds, I’m using the app only because I paid for it and no other reason. I sent this complaint to the customer support team and this was their response: 

“Thank you for reaching out to us. I'm very sorry to hear that you are unhappy with your Natural Cycles experience and please let me know if there's anything we can do to help. I do appreciate that you took the time to share your perspective with us and thank you for sharing your valuable feedback as we are always looking for ways to improve. I have made sure to forward your comments to the responsible team so they can take them into consideration for future developments of the app. Regarding the ability to mark the days you've had sex with a heart emoji, we do currently have this tracker - on your Graph view the days where sex was logged will be marked with a pink heart on top. As for the thermometer, in case this would be accessible to you, we have recently released our NC° Gen3 Thermometer, which offers Bluetooth and a memory function, as well as the ability to turn off/on the beep and backlight. You can find this by going to the menu in the top left corner of your screen > Buy extra supplies. If you have any other questions or thoughts, please do not hesitate to reach out.

 Don’t waste your money and time.

My reply: 

“ Give me a refund and make sure I don’t get charged again. I see from the reviews I’m not the only one with issues and that you are a dishonest company who wrongfully automatically renews subscriptions claiming the warning emails go to spam. 

I do not trust you and nobody should. Companies like this should be blacklisted. Not only are you taking advantage of vulnerable women, but you won’t accept any blame for what you’ve done and won’t even attempt to find resolution.

Sorry doesn’t cut it. Sorry is just a word. We want action. If you’re sorry, prove it. Change your ways. Use ethics, morals and technology instead of just chasing dollars. You may be successful in the amount of money you’re bringing in but one day this business model will fail you. The BBB will hear about this.”

Franny’s response:

I believe the app can be amazing for *some * women. 

Women that:
-don’t drink
-sleep soundly every night
-have no stress or variations in their life/sleep
-have very regular periods
-never get sick 
-don’t get jetlagged
-wouldn’t mind becoming pregnant within one year 
-you don’t mind the fact that the app needs months of data to become accurate (in DIRECT opposite of the marketing slogan “accurate from the first day”)

Aka: the literal opposite of me. But the app/ website did not make that explicit. 

So after a little over a month, I’ve had 0 “Green Day’s”, I’ve had days switch from green to red AFTER getting my unprotected swerve on, and every single green “prediction” turn from green to red. 

Im not the target demo. I travel, I don’t go to sleep and wake up like clockwork, I’ve gotten sick, I’ve been hung over, I don’t have months to wait hoping that the AI figures me out.

When I searched the app store for fertility tracker, this was the first app that came up. It looked highly rated, so I installed it. Before I could even register for a free trial, I had to agree to the $14.50 basal thermometer charge. I figured I would use it, so fine, I agreed, even when I saw no refunds/returns. HOWEVER, the app did not inform me until AFTER this point, when it *then* asked me about my birth control usage, that you can only access the demo mode while you are on birth control, & that basically the app is completely useless to me since I have no intention of going off my birth control pill. So, I went to their site promptly and canceled my trial and pending subscription. That was simple enough.

I've never even had something from Amazon Prime be ""out for delivery"" within 2 hours. I had hoped maybe they would have the decency when they saw how promptly I canceled my trial to actually not complete the charge (to cancel while still pending with my bank), but no, it seems more like they expedited everything to ""excuse"" keeping my money.

If you are looking for a calendar/symptom tracker/reminder app, it does the job just fine. I do like the symptom tracker and notes. It does include a lot of birth control forms too, so that’s nice. On the other hand, the forum between users is a mess. At first I thought the feature was nice, where people can ask unfiltered questions if they aren’t comfortable or able to get in contact with the doctor. Sounds like a great idea too. However, very quickly do I see users say “do your research” and “stop posting questions that people have asked before,” etc. What seems most troubling is that no one appears to be certified, unless they are certified with “clout” because they interact with the comments for YEARS. I have a problem of people writing as if they are professionals. Just because you have researched the pill, or have taken it, does not mean you understand how other people’s bodies respond. My other note is that there can be little compassion towards people who are at different levels of understanding. Yes, I can read the papers on the pill, and look up stuff online, but some people have trouble processing and applying that information. On top of that, pregnancy scares are no joke, and sometimes you need support and help processing. Too many times I’ve read “stop asking questions other people have already asked,” or “just take the information you were given and stop asking” feels very compassionless to the situation. So if you want to post questions, my caution is that some of these women can come off very compassionless because they keep answering similar questions (on their own will too, no one said they had to respond to everyone). I can understand user frustration on both ends, but at the end of the day I think some people really need support through an insecure/uncertain time.

I received another email at 1:05pm informing me that I had a new message, but I couldn’t view either message without ending the video call. 

I waited until 2:15pm in the “waiting room” for the doctor to answer my call, thinking that maybe they were running behind and would get to me eventually, and that’s what the messages were about. Eventually, I realized that the doctor was not going to answer my call, so I ended the video chat. Then I checked the messages to see that at 12:59pm, the doctor informed me they were waiting on my video call. At 1:05pm, they informed me they were cancelling my request because I didn’t answer their video chat, even though I had been in the waiting room that whole time. 

I submitted a new request, but there isn’t a new video chat opening for 5 days, which means I likely won’t get my prescription in time.
