I was taking a specific birth control prescribed by Nurx and everything was going great. I got a text literally saying ‚ÄúWe're preparing your prescription refill in the next few days. No action is required from you :).‚Äù Nowhere did they say they were switching my medication to generic, nor did the text state the name of the medication, and since it clearly stated ‚Äòrefill‚Äô I assumed it was the same medication. 

The next text from Nurx was a confirmation text that my birth control had shipped but in this text it listed the name of the medication which was totally different. The was not notice anywhere else that I would be receiving a generic version until AFTER they had already shipped it. 

I called customer service panicking because anyone who takes medication knows generics can be totally different than name brands. I personally have had horrible reactions to generics before, and additionally I have a thyroid condition and maintaining hormone balance is already a real issue for me. To have my medication switched with no notice was extremely upsetting.

The customer service representative and supervisor both assured me the medical team would take care of it, but I just received a message from the doctor basically saying, ‚Äútoo bad too sad it‚Äôs already shipped and those conditions don‚Äôt qualify you for non generic.‚Äù
