I don't need or want that as I input the info myself in settings... 
it seems like they could leave article info as an additional block next to log symptoms. Again, you can't close them the My Cycle blocks and it's not info I want to see right away. I miss the old format. I would rather scroll down on the main page for symptom input. I dont think i'll stick around much longer.

12/10/23 22:32,,"EDIT: FLO IS FABRICATING 4-STAR REVIEWS USING AI BOTS. Check recent reviews and you can EASILY see that there are a bunch of bots writing absolutely nonsensical reviews with random titles and descriptions with 4 stars. It’s CLEARLY a bot because these “users” making the reviews have super similar names too. DISGUSTING! Flo, you’re sick. You can claim to help women and people with periods but at the end of the day, you just want MONEY and PROFIT. The developers and higher ups of this app and company should be disgusted with themselves for valuing money over actually helping people with periods and their health. Capitalism will destroy us and this app is part of the problem. 

Original review: This app does the job. It tracks my period. But to even get into the app to see my tracker, I have to click out of their ads for their subscription service. I have to click out of at least 3 before I can even see my tracker. Plus, most of the features they advertise in the app store is part of the subscription. This is so deceptive bc the App Store listing shows and describes all these features AND the app is free. So of course when you download it, you’d expect those things. Another thing is the app will have you start submitting your symptoms with their chat bot, and then cuts you off right when it’s going to give you information with a big pay wall. Listen, I get it, but it’s just so excessive. Also, they constantly advertise that their subscription is on sale at the lowest price of the year… but they say that ALL the time. It’s just scummy. Don’t offer me help for my period and give me the impression that it’s included, and then block me with the pay wall.",1,FALSE,juliebuliebobulie,DISGUSTING SCAMMERS,flo-period-pregnancy-tracker,1038369065

Aside from needing premium to do basically anything on the app I wish there was an option to check off that you skipped a period or two by skipping your placebo week of birth control pills.

I recommended this app to my friends for all sorts of uses, and especially the “other” category was a huge perk.

It was simple, functional and reliable. You didn't have to create an account so data privacy was top notch. It helped me collect data to diagnose a medical issue and track the subsequent data to know when the issue subsided.

There's been a huge relaunch recently (2022 or 23) and the app is now completely unusable if not connected to data. It has too many different features I don't care about and is constantly pinging me to pay for Clue Plus while not reliably displaying my historic data. 

It looks like the new period tracking data options are significantly improved, but forcing me to create an account, store my health data on a server instead of my phone, and spamming me with the pay features is a no for me.

The bot also said it’s not a Flo problem, it’s an Apple problem. I’m going to have to call my bank and have them blocked.

We can assure you we're working hard to bring back the missing feature, but we're sorry that they've been missing for so long from the app. Also, there will always be a free version of Clue, because we deeply understand the need for accessibility when it comes to the information and tools Clue offers. We welcome feedback from all of our users, and review it regularly when left via our helloclue.com website. However, it’s expensive to build and maintain an app for millions of users around the world and while there are ways for free apps to make money by selling user data or showing ads to users, we don’t do that at Clue.

It’s been free to use this entire time with a paid option to be part of the “community features”. I’ve had no use for that so just stuck with the free version. 

Unfortunately the developer is “rebuilding the app” for months now and removed a SIGNIFICANT amount of features - currently the app doesn’t even have any notification settings to tell you when to expect your period. 

Their paywall now blocks the community features as well as *customer support* you literally cannot get them to respond to an email unless you pay for their overpriced subscription.

I started using Clue in 2014. Today, in the blink of an eye and certainly without notice, eight full years of valuable health information is gone. All of my custom notes about symptoms, gone. Gone and presumably unable to be recovered because of the new update that seems to have done little more than provide a facelift for the app. 

Also, how is it possible that the update was released only allowing you to track one kind of birth control? What about those who use a ring? Or another option? I used to feel that this app was truly designed with the user in mind. Not anymore.
