    "\"This whole business is a scam. It’s an exhausting and consistently frustrating take on a crucial service. I absolutely love the concept of getting it delivered and being able to do it all online. First month was fine. Every month since they have tried charging my card anywhere from $8-$10 even though under my insurance all forms of birth control pills are free at no cost to me at all. Every time I’ve tried to explain that to the staff at Nurx their only response is to talk to my insurance… even if I’ve already told them that I have. I can explain it to them all day I only get automated responses, never any real help at all. Also the customer service is the worst I’ve seen on any online platform. It takes up to 6 days for someone to get back to you on anything. The earliest for me was 3 days. So you send them a message and by the time they respond you’re so close to running out of pills that you rush to get it taken care of. \n",
    "Also you can specify on your app settings that you want to be notified if insurance doesn’t cover it before you’re charged. At first I had it turned off then after the second month I turned it on. Well then they just charged me without any heads up the third month, completely ignoring my preference. Then, when I looked at the settings it was gone. \n",
