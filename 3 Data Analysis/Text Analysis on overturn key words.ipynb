       "0    Nurx used to be super helpful when I first started using it. It was really quick and easy to get the medication to your door, especially when it’s really hard for me to see an in-person doctor due to my work schedule. However, they have stopped doing their job. I understand that they had a huge influx of customers due to all of the birth control/abortion issues going on, but if they do not have the resources to keep up with all of their patients, they should stop accepting patients. It used to be a live chat service for $60 annually(not including the price of the medication and a monthly shipping fee), but they have now stopped that feature so I’m lucky if someone responds in a week. I went two months without my migraine medication because they kept claiming they were putting the prescription through and then suddenly the pharmacy would have an issue, then the order got cancelled on Nurx’s side for whatever reason, and still Nurx just kept telling me the same thing over and over (that they would look into it which never happened until I threatened to cancel my membership). They do not care about the patients, they care about the money they get from the annual membership fee. If you need your medication consistently, Nurx is not going to help you.\n",

Quite a few messages have gone unanswered about where my order is or if I will get a new order processed.   Really a frustrating experience.

They’re extremely understaffed, which I understand after Roe V. Wade was overturned.\\n\\nBut it takes ages to get a response. First, I was told my insurance wouldn’t be accepted, but then received an apology for “the confusion” and that my order would go through. (Birth control pills are free through my insurance.)\\n\\nI already paid the yearly $25 consultation fee, and was told I’d get a shipping notification in 2-3 business days, which I never did. After messaging them about it, I was met with “At this time, we cannot work with your insurance”. What? I was given the go ahead that I’d be sent my birth control, but no.\\n\\nI requested a refund for the consultation fee.

When we found out we were expecting, not trying, but not preventing, the very first thing this app tells you is how you can terminate your unplanned pregnancy (kill your child) and to seek the help of planned parenthood, and that there’s no right or wrong. THE FIRST PROMPT ON THE SCREEN. These people are responsible for the murder of 64 million babies to date. Nothing “natural”about starving out your child in the womb, inducing cardiac arrest and dismembering it, which is what abortion is. NO THANK YOU! These people are an evil bunch, run!\n",

When you get the app they constantly remove features with their updates and tell you to purchase the premium option in order to get it back. This app is truly sickening and I hope that those white old men realize what their doing is sick and that no teenager deserves to give birth if they   are not prepared for it.

Speaking of tracking, this app is used to sell information which includes health data and when you’ll ovulate.

Once I downloaded it, I loved tracking my symptoms. I love being able to know where I’m at in my cycle and love the alerts on what to expect (headache, calm moods, etc) and overall, I just enjoyed using the app. Now, you can’t even open the app without it trying to force you into a premium membership. You open the app, ad. You click something, ad. You log something, ad. You scroll down, ad. They changed the app color to red (no not the background on the app but the actual app color) and since then, it’s all been downhill. As they lose more and more customers, they’ll realize these were bad business moves. \\n\\nWe all understand how businesses work, we know you need premium memberships to fund your app, and when you offered the $1/month offers during Christmas and new years, I was SO close to subscribing (I’ve never paid for an app so I didn’t do it) but forcing people into memberships is not how to do it. Good businesses don’t take away from nonmembers, they offer more for premium members. \\n\\nHopefully y’all will realize the mistakes and fix it so we can all come back. Until then…</td>\n",

       "      <td>I have been using clue since my freshmen year of high school, so around 7+ years so far. This app is essentially unusable now. I understand why clue felt it was necessary to remove the Fertile Window however; removing this feature entirely felt like the wrong move for the user base, especially when it could have just been made optional. I never used this feature as birth control nor did most other users I have seen discussing this app, but it most certainly did help me be more safe during those days and helped to alleviate my cycle-related anxiety tenfold. For a feature that also helps women who are using the app explicitly to become pregnant and/or track pregnancy, it was certainly a strange decision to make. \\n\\nWith that being said, most of clue’s best features require payment, including pregnancy tracking. I understand why a developer would include their own articles in their subscription based service, but forcing users to pay to simply track their pregnancy progress is unnecessary and absurd. \\n\\nFinally, the app does not even display my predicted ovulation day despite having the setting on. I have tried updating the app, making sure my account is properly synced, deleting the app, etc., and it still would not at all appear. When I did delete the app trying to get it to work properly, I lost all of my data despite having an account made with Clue. It was not ever clear that your data must be backed up then restored manually. I’m having trouble understanding why you would ask your user base to make an account to sync their data if their data does not automatically sync. \\n\\nIt’s truly a shame. Following the overturning of Roe v Wade, I don’t trust American period tracking apps, as most of them *will* turn your personal and private data over to authorities (including Flo). Clue was an app that felt safe, but ultimately I’m having a hard time using it when it cannot even display my predicted ovulation day and wiped all of my data.</td>\n",

Shame on you Flo for selling womens information and hunting down my sisters trying to get abortions. This app sells your information!! do not trust her, she is a LIAR. They keep responding to others here that they don’t do this but read the fine print they are liars and anti choice. Shame on you Flo for being anti-choice and I hope you guys get cancelled “As per NYT: Users with privacy concerns might have found comfort in Flo’s promise to keep select information collected through its app secret, noting that, even as it might share some personal data with other companies, it would not disclose details about “cycles, pregnancy, symptoms notes and other information that is entered by you.” It turns out that promise was misleading, regulators say. From 2016 to 2019, the company behind Flo, which was founded in 2015, passed on certain intimate health details of its users to marketing and analytics companies like Facebook and Google, according to the Federal Trade Commission, which filed a complaint in January saying it had reason to believe that THE COMPANY MISLEADS ITS USERS”   \n",

I am in shock that this email was sent but especially on such a monumental day as Mother’s Day. How heartless and cruel of you to promote killing babies on this precious day. It’s disgusting! \\n\\n“In the aftermath of the historic overturn of Roe v Wade, clinics are closing, citizens face prosecution for providing or accessing care, health education is being limited, and social media continues to power the spread of misinformation. We commissioned a report to uncover the truth about the state of women’s health in post-Roe America. What we found was startling.”  \\n\\nWhat is startling is that that you use these fearmonger tactics and LIE to vulnerable woman!!! Not a single word of abortion in your email when clearly that’s what you’re talking about. This is solely to SCARE women. Woman will NOT be limited in the care they receive. They will still receive the best care from their clinics, hospitals, and doctors. For you to say otherwise is a LIE! Abortion facilities KILLING innocent babies should be shut down for the safety and well-being of every child and woman!   \n",

I used Flo for about the year but I think i’ll stick to my calendar now. Its extremely sick how our provate information is being constantly recorded, tracked, trafficked, and sent directly to the government. So what people want to use condoms or want an abortion. That is life and you cannot control that. How about if you were physically or mentally incapable of giving birth to a human.  A human? I hate how its a bunch of white old men who make this decision for us women. We are not yours anymore. We are our own people, for the love of god please do not use this app. Adding on to this I would like to comment the the pressure to use the premium feature. When you get the app they constantly remove features with their updates and tell you to purchase the premium option in order to get it back. This app is truly sickening and I hope that those white old men realize what their doing is sick and that no teenager deserves to give birth if they   are not prepared for it. No woman should give birth if they are not prepared for it. I will be taking my business somewhere else. I am truly unsatisfied and I hope that this business completely fails.   \n",

As an iPhone user since 2008 this is my first review of an app. Someone else said using the chat feature for a few mins just to need premium right there at the end- cruel, indeed. I also feel like the notifications such as “you max experience a headache today” may actually cause a headache because the seed has been planted and cause the user to feel those effects because the app mentioned it. Silly especially since I never logged those symptoms ever. I only use the app to track ovulation. Speaking of tracking, this app is used to sell information which includes health data and when you’ll ovulate. What a violation especially in times during roe v wade and you’ll have to manually switch the app settings so you won’t be tracked. Another app has come out which is free and doesn’t sell info. Flo you have sold out. Women are a business to you. This isn’t an app for women in mind. As if paying for pads and tampons isn’t enough we have to pay for the app. 0/5 stars.   \n",

Flo has decided you are not worthy, unless you pay for a premium membership. \\n\\nI came to Flo after the horrifying Roe V Wade incidents recently and read through to make sure they weren’t selling info. Once I downloaded it, I loved tracking my symptoms. I love being able to know where I’m at in my cycle and love the alerts on what to expect (headache, calm moods, etc) and overall, I just enjoyed using the app. Now, you can’t even open the app without it trying to force you into a premium membership. You open the app, ad. You click something, ad. You log something, ad. You scroll down, ad. They changed the app color to red (no not the background on the app but the actual app color) and since then, it’s all been downhill. As they lose more and more customers, they’ll realize these were bad business moves. \\n\\nWe all understand how businesses work, we know you need premium memberships to fund your app, and when you offered the $1/month offers during Christmas and new years, I was SO close to subscribing (I’ve never paid for an app so I didn’t do it) but forcing people into memberships is not how to do it. Good businesses don’t take away from nonmembers, they offer more for premium members. \\n\\nHopefully y’all will realize the mistakes and fix it so we can all come back. Until then…   \n",

       "242  I have been using clue since my freshmen year of high school, so around 7+ years so far. This app is essentially unusable now. I understand why clue felt it was necessary to remove the Fertile Window however; removing this feature entirely felt like the wrong move for the user base, especially when it could have just been made optional. I never used this feature as birth control nor did most other users I have seen discussing this app, but it most certainly did help me be more safe during those days and helped to alleviate my cycle-related anxiety tenfold. For a feature that also helps women who are using the app explicitly to become pregnant and/or track pregnancy, it was certainly a strange decision to make. \\n\\nWith that being said, most of clue’s best features require payment, including pregnancy tracking. I understand why a developer would include their own articles in their subscription based service, but forcing users to pay to simply track their pregnancy progress is unnecessary and absurd. \\n\\nFinally, the app does not even display my predicted ovulation day despite having the setting on. I have tried updating the app, making sure my account is properly synced, deleting the app, etc., and it still would not at all appear. When I did delete the app trying to get it to work properly, I lost all of my data despite having an account made with Clue. It was not ever clear that your data must be backed up then restored manually. I’m having trouble understanding why you would ask your user base to make an account to sync their data if their data does not automatically sync. \\n\\nIt’s truly a shame. Following the overturning of Roe v Wade, I don’t trust American period tracking apps, as most of them *will* turn your personal and private data over to authorities (including Flo). Clue was an app that felt safe, but ultimately I’m having a hard time using it when it cannot even display my predicted ovulation day and wiped all of my data.   \n",

People are flipping out because clue has lost years of their data. Can’t log in, can’t do anything while they “rebuild” the app. Excuse me? Why would they need to do this? Many people migrated to Clue after Roe was overturned because they claimed they were more secure. Clearly not.   \n",

Shame on you Flo for selling womens information and hunting down my sisters trying to get abortions. This app sells your information!! do not trust her, she is a LIAR. They keep responding to others here that they don’t do this but read the fine print they are liars and anti choice. Shame on you Flo for being anti-choice and I hope you guys get cancelled “As per NYT: Users with privacy concerns might have found comfort in Flo’s promise to keep select information collected through its app secret, noting that, even as it might share some personal data with other companies, it would not disclose details about “cycles, pregnancy, symptoms notes and other information that is entered by you.” It turns out that promise was misleading, regulators say. From 2016 to 2019, the company behind Flo, which was founded in 2015, passed on certain intimate health details of its users to marketing and analytics companies like Facebook and Google, according to the Federal Trade Commission, which filed a complaint in January saying it had reason to believe that THE COMPANY MISLEADS ITS USERS”\n",

I am in shock that this email was sent but especially on such a monumental day as Mother’s Day. How heartless and cruel of you to promote killing babies on this precious day. It’s disgusting! \\n\\n“In the aftermath of the historic overturn of Roe v Wade, clinics are closing, citizens face prosecution for providing or accessing care, health education is being limited, and social media continues to power the spread of misinformation. We commissioned a report to uncover the truth about the state of women’s health in post-Roe America. What we found was startling.”  \\n\\nWhat is startling is that that you use these fearmonger tactics and LIE to vulnerable woman!!! Not a single word of abortion in your email when clearly that’s what you’re talking about. This is solely to SCARE women. Woman will NOT be limited in the care they receive. They will still receive the best care from their clinics, hospitals, and doctors. For you to say otherwise is a LIE! Abortion facilities KILLING innocent babies should be shut down for the safety and well-being of every child and woman!\n",

I used Flo for about the year but I think i’ll stick to my calendar now. Its extremely sick how our provate information is being constantly recorded, tracked, trafficked, and sent directly to the government. So what people want to use condoms or want an abortion. That is life and you cannot control that. How about if you were physically or mentally incapable of giving birth to a human.  A human? I hate how its a bunch of white old men who make this decision for us women. We are not yours anymore. We are our own people, for the love of god please do not use this app. Adding on to this I would like to comment the the pressure to use the premium feature. When you get the app they constantly remove features with their updates and tell you to purchase the premium option in order to get it back. This app is truly sickening and I hope that those white old men realize what their doing is sick and that no teenager deserves to give birth if they   are not prepared for it. No woman should give birth if they are not prepared for it. I will be taking my business somewhere else. I am truly unsatisfied and I hope that this business completely fails.\n",

As an iPhone user since 2008 this is my first review of an app. Someone else said using the chat feature for a few mins just to need premium right there at the end- cruel, indeed. I also feel like the notifications such as “you max experience a headache today” may actually cause a headache because the seed has been planted and cause the user to feel those effects because the app mentioned it. Silly especially since I never logged those symptoms ever. I only use the app to track ovulation. Speaking of tracking, this app is used to sell information which includes health data and when you’ll ovulate. What a violation especially in times during roe v wade and you’ll have to manually switch the app settings so you won’t be tracked. Another app has come out which is free and doesn’t sell info. Flo you have sold out. Women are a business to you. This isn’t an app for women in mind. As if paying for pads and tampons isn’t enough we have to pay for the app. 0/5 stars.\n",

Flo has decided you are not worthy, unless you pay for a premium membership. \\n\\nI came to Flo after the horrifying Roe V Wade incidents recently and read through to make sure they weren’t selling info. Once I downloaded it, I loved tracking my symptoms. I love being able to know where I’m at in my cycle and love the alerts on what to expect (headache, calm moods, etc) and overall, I just enjoyed using the app. Now, you can’t even open the app without it trying to force you into a premium membership. You open the app, ad. You click something, ad. You log something, ad. You scroll down, ad. They changed the app color to red (no not the background on the app but the actual app color) and since then, it’s all been downhill. As they lose more and more customers, they’ll realize these were bad business moves. \\n\\nWe all understand how businesses work, we know you need premium memberships to fund your app, and when you offered the $1/month offers during Christmas and new years, I was SO close to subscribing (I’ve never paid for an app so I didn’t do it) but forcing people into memberships is not how to do it. Good businesses don’t take away from nonmembers, they offer more for premium members. \\n\\nHopefully y’all will realize the mistakes and fix it so we can all come back. Until then…\n",

       "242    I have been using clue since my freshmen year of high school, so around 7+ years so far. This app is essentially unusable now. I understand why clue felt it was necessary to remove the Fertile Window however; removing this feature entirely felt like the wrong move for the user base, especially when it could have just been made optional. I never used this feature as birth control nor did most other users I have seen discussing this app, but it most certainly did help me be more safe during those days and helped to alleviate my cycle-related anxiety tenfold. For a feature that also helps women who are using the app explicitly to become pregnant and/or track pregnancy, it was certainly a strange decision to make. \\n\\nWith that being said, most of clue’s best features require payment, including pregnancy tracking. I understand why a developer would include their own articles in their subscription based service, but forcing users to pay to simply track their pregnancy progress is unnecessary and absurd. \\n\\nFinally, the app does not even display my predicted ovulation day despite having the setting on. I have tried updating the app, making sure my account is properly synced, deleting the app, etc., and it still would not at all appear. When I did delete the app trying to get it to work properly, I lost all of my data despite having an account made with Clue. It was not ever clear that your data must be backed up then restored manually. I’m having trouble understanding why you would ask your user base to make an account to sync their data if their data does not automatically sync. \\n\\nIt’s truly a shame. Following the overturning of Roe v Wade, I don’t trust American period tracking apps, as most of them *will* turn your personal and private data over to authorities (including Flo). Clue was an app that felt safe, but ultimately I’m having a hard time using it when it cannot even display my predicted ovulation day and wiped all of my data.\n",

People are flipping out because clue has lost years of their data. Can’t log in, can’t do anything while they “rebuild” the app. Excuse me? Why would they need to do this? Many people migrated to Clue after Roe was overturned because they claimed they were more secure. Clearly not.\n",
