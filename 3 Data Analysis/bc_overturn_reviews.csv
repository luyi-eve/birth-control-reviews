It was really quick and easy to get the medication to your door, especially when it’s really hard for me to see an in-person doctor due to my work schedule. However, they have stopped doing their job. I understand that they had a huge influx of customers due to all of the birth control/abortion issues going on, but if they do not have the resources to keep up with all of their patients, they should stop accepting patients. It used to be a live chat service for $60 annually(not including the price of the medication and a monthly shipping fee), but they have now stopped that feature so I’m lucky if someone responds in a week. I went two months without my migraine medication because they kept claiming they were putting the prescription through and then suddenly the pharmacy would have an issue, then the order got cancelled on Nurx’s side for whatever reason, and still Nurx just kept telling me the same thing over and over (that they would look into it which never happened until I threatened to cancel my membership). They do not care about the patients, they care about the money they get from the annual membership fee. If you need your medication consistently, Nurx is not going to help you.",1,False,777xxxxx777,No longer worth it,nurx-birth-control-delivered,1213141301,"- l2_delayed_customer_service

Quite a few messages have gone unanswered about where my order is or if I will get a new order processed.   Really a frustrating experience.

They’re extremely understaffed, which I understand after Roe V. Wade was overturned.

But it takes ages to get a response. First, I was told my insurance wouldn’t be accepted, but then received an apology for “the confusion” and that my order would go through. (Birth control pills are free through my insurance.)

I already paid the yearly $25 consultation fee, and was told I’d get a shipping notification in 2-3 business days, which I never did. After messaging them about it, I was met with “At this time, we cannot work with your insurance”. What? I was given the go ahead that I’d be sent my birth control, but no.

I requested a refund for the consultation fee. They confirmed they’d send it in 5-7 business days, but I don’t even trust that. They’re awful.

Never in my life have I complained about a business to the BBB, but I did for Nurx. Do NOT waste your money, time, or mental/physical health on Nurx.

They have a 1.74/5 stars on BBB for a reason.",1,False,2suns-in-the-sunset,"Terrible Service, Waste of Money.",nurx-birth-control-delivered,1213141301,"- l2_delayed_customer_service
