Now i find myself deleting this app in complete disappointment towards the team behind this. And app created for women being used as a weapon towards the same women it promised to help before? Completely nauseating action. To sell our data, do not care for our mental health or or physical health, to not care for our rights that are being ripped away from us. Disappointing is not enough of a word to express my feeling towards this app and their creator, traitors may be a more suitable word to describe y’all. Women rights are not optional, abortion is a right and will continue to happen, the only thing that changes is going to be the great amount of women who will have risky abortions and I blame it on white misogynistic republican men and anyone who supports them including you. Roe v Wade is not the end of it, It’s the beginning of a new era of women taking what is owned to them, we will get our rights back, while you guys choke on your own hurtful narrative. 

I hope every women out there finds themselves a better app to track their period, an app that will not be selling our data for their own gain.

At first I was pleased that there was a pregnancy tracking option that I could switch to with my most recent pregnancy until I noticed that they never once use the word baby. They always refer to my child in the womb as a fetus. I know this is the medical term but all it means is ""unborn young"", i.e. a baby. We all know that people insist on using the term ""fetus"" and avoid saying ""baby"" when they want to de-personalize the child in the womb because they don't want to admit that abortion kills a baby. I just noticed today that under the ""About Clue"" section of the app there is an article called ""One year post-Roe..."" about how sad it is that women lost the constitutional right to kill their own children in the womb. So I suppose I shouldn't be surprised by how bland and impersonal the pregnancy tracker is. You definitely get the impression that they are not happy or celebrating that you are bringing a new life into the world. It's very sad. And for an app that claims to be pro-women, it's the very opposite. The ability to nurture and carry life in our bodies is one of the most beautiful aspects of being a woman and what makes us uniquely different from men.

I also just found a section in an article under the ""Pregnancy"" section about the stages of development where they straight up admit that they use the terms embryo and fetus instead of baby so that people won't have negative attitudes toward abortion.

With no warning, they forced all users to make an account and send their data to their servers. For those who previously didn't have an account and just had data stored on their own device, they were forced to make an account to access that data. For those who are concerned about privacy, this is a big drawback. It also means now you can't add new data without an internet connection. 

Custom tags and their previous data disappeared for nearly two months (and for some users, forever). This is particularly unforgivable. This is a period/birth control tracking app, which means it needs to be reliable. If it's wrong or missing data, someone could end up unintentionally pregnant, and in the US where abortion is no longer protected, that's more critical than it's been in decades. Even for those who aren't worried about pregnancy, having their health data wiped or inaccessible for even a month can adversely affect them. I was using custom tags to track long-term patterns. Years of that data was inaccessible to me for two months.

While they did restore that feature after two months, it's still unforgivable that they knowingly deprived their users of their health data. They easily could have waited until their update was finished before pushing it out. 

And there was no warning. No notice to export or backup your data before a major update. No advisory that parts of your data will be inaccessible for the near future. No warning that you will be forced to make an account with them to view your previous data. 

I quite liked Clue before this update.  It didn't require an account, it was simple, it allowed custom tags, it was reliable, and they said they cared about their users' data and privacy.

Unfortunately, this fiasco has shown how little they care about their users' data. Will years of my health information be wiped the next time I update the app? I can no longer trust them. Judging by the many other one-star reviews since December, I'm far from alone in this. 

Of course, one of the features that's been removed is exporting your data.",2,False,OneHundredSeven,Disappointed by Recent Events,clue-period-tracker-calendar,657189652,#NAME?,0.603311278,0,1,1,0

I understand why clue felt it was necessary to remove the Fertile Window however; removing this feature entirely felt like the wrong move for the user base, especially when it could have just been made optional. I never used this feature as birth control nor did most other users I have seen discussing this app, but it most certainly did help me be more safe during those days and helped to alleviate my cycle-related anxiety tenfold. For a feature that also helps women who are using the app explicitly to become pregnant and/or track pregnancy, it was certainly a strange decision to make. 

With that being said, most of clue’s best features require payment, including pregnancy tracking. I understand why a developer would include their own articles in their subscription based service, but forcing users to pay to simply track their pregnancy progress is unnecessary and absurd. 

Finally, the app does not even display my predicted ovulation day despite having the setting on. I have tried updating the app, making sure my account is properly synced, deleting the app, etc., and it still would not at all appear. When I did delete the app trying to get it to work properly, I lost all of my data despite having an account made with Clue. It was not ever clear that your data must be backed up then restored manually. I’m having trouble understanding why you would ask your user base to make an account to sync their data if their data does not automatically sync. 

It’s truly a shame. Following the overturning of Roe v Wade, I don’t trust American period tracking apps, as most of them *will* turn your personal and private data over to authorities (including Flo). Clue was an app that felt safe, but ultimately I’m having a hard time using it when it cannot even display my predicted ovulation day and wiped all of my data.",1,False,S.L.Y.
